# Crappy 2D Physics Engine
Something I threw together while I was bored, you can grab objects and throw them around the screen. The code could definetly be refactored and improved but I'm not actively working on this project.

# Dependencies
pygame: ```pip install pygame```

# Usage
Everything is in ```main.py```, simply run it using ```python main.py```.
